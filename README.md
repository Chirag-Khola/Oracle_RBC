This project presents a rule-based chatbot designed for WhatsApp. The implementation utilizes Python libraries for WhatsApp automation, mouse tracking, and natural language processing.
1.1 Background
The chatbot reads incoming messages and responds contextually using predefined rules. The integration enhances user engagement by adapting responses based on on-screen activities.

1.2 Problem Statement
In the current landscape of digital communication, users often face challenges in accessing contextual information swiftly within messaging platforms. Traditional chatbots lack real-time interaction cues, limiting their adaptability to user activities. This project addresses the need for an interactive and context-aware solution by developing a rule-based chatbot integrated with WhatsApp, empowered with real-time mouse pointer tracking. The aim is to provide users with a dynamic and responsive conversational experience, bridging the gap between static chatbot interactions and the real-time context of user activities on their devices.

2. Methodology

2.1 Tools and Technologies Used
1. Python: The primary programming language for developing the chatbot and its associated functionalities.
2. Pyautogui: Utilized for real-time mouse pointer tracking, enabling the chatbot to capture and analyse user interactions on the device.
3. Pyperclip: Employed for clipboard operations, facilitating the chatbot's ability to read and manipulate text content.
4. Random Module: Integrated for generating random responses or actions, adding variability to the chatbot's interactions.
5. Time Module: Utilized for incorporating time-related functionalities, such as scheduling and pacing of automated responses.
